Internet Shame Insurance is a very simple Google Chrome extension that adds privacy reminders to Facebook, Twitter, and Gmail to help you avoid the most common online communication faux pas. The extension sits in the background and springs into action only when you're about to post a status update or reply all. 

<h3>Stop Upsetting Your Mom on Facebook</h3>

Whether you're updating your status or commenting on someone else's post, you'll get a gentle reminder of the privacy settings for that post.

Tweets work differently depending on whether you're @mentioning someone, DMing someone, or tweeting to the world at large. Internet Shame Insurance Helps You Identify the Difference

<h3>No More Embarrassing, Accidental Reply Alls</h3>

Need a reminder that you may not want to reply all when you're complaining about someone in the thread? Internet Shame Insurance gives you that reminder, only when you've hit Reply to all for a message.<br clear="all" />

<h3>FAQ: This Is Dumb</h3>
Hey, we could all use a little help occasionally. If you don't need an extension to help you avoid this kind of online embarrassment, that's fine. But if you wouldn't mind a little extra help--or a little insurance, as it were, against that kind of online shame--then install the extension and enjoy. Obviously it's not going to help you if you're using, say, a Twitter client rather than the Twitter.com homepage, but it'll help where it can.
